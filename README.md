# Quantium-Virtual-Interniship


## Quantium Virtual Internship: Project Overview
* Undertook data cleaning, transformation and preparation of a large sample dataset from a major retailer

* Carried out customer analytics to derive insights into customer spending behaviour and high performing products

* Developed a strategy for the spending manager to implement, which would optimise slaes for specific product categories

* Created a measure to compare different control stores against stores which had recently trialled new layouts

* Used the most suitable control store to benchark performance and used performance analytics to assess the impact of new layouts in trial stores

### Resources
* Python Version: 3.7

* Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

* Project Basis: Virtual Internship with Quantium

### Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
* This consisted of the following stages:

* Examined transaction data looking for inconsistencies, missing data and outliers

* Cleaned the data using ordinal mapping and filling of missing values and outliers with statistical best fit values

* Merged customer data with transaction data to create a unified sales dataset

* Defined performance metrics and identified total sales, drivers of sales and highest performing products

* Conducted a deep dive into customer segments to advise which segments should be targeted.

* Some highlights are below.
